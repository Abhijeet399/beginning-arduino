# Arduino Introduction

The Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform that utilizes an 8-bit (in the case of the UNO) Atmel AVR micro-controller, coupled with a software development environment, compiler, and bootloader. Arduinos comes in many sizes and shapes, from different manufacturers. One of the main goals of the Arduino developers was to make hardware development less expensive and more easily accessible.

Arduino makes it easy to create devices that interact with the physical world. They are used extensively by designers and hobbyists. There are tons of great sources for information online, and lots of great code libraries freely available.
